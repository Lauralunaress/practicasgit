<p><em>Git</em> ours that are in the repos<br />
Compressed be your <em>commits</em><br />
Come to us your <em>log</em><br />
In the local as in the <em>remote</em><br />
Give us today our daily pull
Forgive our <em>conflicts</em><br />
As we also forgive those of other geeks<br />
Don't let us fall into <em>detached HEAD</em><br />
and deliver us from <em>SVN</em><br />
<code>git commit --amend</code></p>
